Explanation:

    def showNextImage(step=0):
> This function will be called repeatedly. Each "step" controls how far the fade we are (From 0 to FADE_STEPS)

    nextIndex = (imageIndex[0] + 1) % len(loadedImages) => This just makes sures that when we reach the end of the list we will go back to the start
    nextImage = loadedImages[nextIndex]
> Basically it calculates the next image index and loops back to the start if it reaches the end
> Loads the preprocessed next images from the list "loadedImages"

    alpha = step / FADE_STEPS
    blend = Image.blend(currImage[0], nextImage, alpha)
> This calculates the "alpha" for blending images which is a float from 0.0 (start) to 1.0 (end)
> Blending the current image and next image based on "alpha" to simulate fading

    tkImage = ImageTk.PhotoImage(blend)
    label.config(image=tkImage)
    label.image = tkImage
> Converts the blended image to a format Tkinter understands which is the tkImage part (line 47)
> Updates the "label" with the blended image and caches it to prevent gc (garbage collection)

    if step < FADE_STEPS:
            imagePlacementFrame.after(FADE_DELAY, lambda: showNextImage(step + 1))
> If the fading is not done, it will schedule the next fade frame after a delay (FADE_DELAY ms)
> lambda: showNextImage(step + 1) ensures the next blend step happens correctly.

    else:
        imageIndex[0] = nextIndex
        currImage[0] = nextImage
        imagePlacementFrame.after(DELAY_SHOWIMAGE, showNextImage)
> If the fading is DONE:
     > Update the currImage[0] to be the new base image used for the next transition
     > Waits for DELAY_SHOWIMAGE ms before starting the next image fading.

Example:
   currImage[0] = hotel1.jpg
   nextImage = hotel2.jpg

   once the fading is done.

   currImage[0] = hotel2.jpg, this means hotel2.jpg will replace hotel1.jpg
   same goes for imageIndex.

   basically we are just replacing the lists.

   We made currImage and imageIndex lists so that they are mutable or can be passed around.
